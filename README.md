## Work in progress

I am actively working on the following features and improvements:

-   **Undo/Redo Functionality**: Implementing undo and redo actions to improve user experience.
-   **Export Options**: Allowing users to export their sketches as images or PDFs.

This plugin is a contribution to the Obsidian community, and I work on it in my free time. As a result, I may be slow to react if anything is asked. Thank you for your understanding and patience.
